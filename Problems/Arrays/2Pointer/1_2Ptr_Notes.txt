When do we want to use two pointer?
    - SORTED arrays
    - We want to modify array in place
        - Want to find specific "good" values
        - Want to reorganize by swapping

There are usually two types of two pointer problems

I: Pointers at the ends of the iterable
    - we have a pointer at front and back
    - we walk both pointers towards the middle until they are equal
    Examples:
        1. Palindrome
        2. Reverse array or reverse string
        3. Two Sum - Sorted

II. Traversal pointer and Trailing Writer pointer
    - Two pointers start iteration at same location, but different step size
    - The Traversal pointer reads over all elements in O(N), can be implemented via for loop
    - The Writer pointer writes in the values that we want
        - Writer pointer may overwrite original values to achieve O(1) space
        - NOTE: The Writer pointer should never pass Traversal pointer
    Examples:
        1. FIND GOOD VALUES: Remove duplicates / Find unique
        2. SWAP problems: Move zeroes to end / sort odds then evens
