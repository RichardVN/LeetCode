"Find the minimal k , such that condition(k) is True"


Map sorted array into True or False based on condition

Sorted Array: [ a, b, c, d, e]
Condition?  : [ F, F, F, T, T]
                         L
                         ^ After while loop, L will be the first k that satisfies condition.
                            
1. Initialize the boundary variables left and right to specify search space. Include ALL possible elements;
2. Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1? TODO: Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition function;
3. Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.
