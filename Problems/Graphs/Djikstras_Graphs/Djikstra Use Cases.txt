When to use Djikstra's? 
- Unweighted, NonNegative Graphs:  find shortest path from ONE source to ALL destinations
- Can work on directed and non-directed graphs

Implementation:
* might have to process edges into a map of Node -> Neighbor List
- Similar to BFS, but use minHeap instead of queue or stack data structure
- Push / pop  tuples to minHeap:  (distanceFromSource, Node)        # TODO: note that distance has to be first, for sorting
- Whenever we push, we add to the distanceNodeToNeighbor to distanceFromSource

TIME:  O(V + E * logV) => O (E log V)
SPACE: O(V)
