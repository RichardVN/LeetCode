When to use Prim's?
- use to find Minimum Spanning Tree of Nodes.  Aka. what is the lowest cost way to connect all vertices?
- Implementation:  identical to Djikstra, except we add (cost, Node) to min Heap instead of (distance_from_source, Node)

Time: O(E log V)  .... max heap size is V, but we can push E times   TODO: same as djikstra
Space: O(V)   .... data structure space, heap of V vertices
