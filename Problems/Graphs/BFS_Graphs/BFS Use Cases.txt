When to use DFS?
- Shortest Path of UNWEIGHTED graph
- Traverse all vertices of graph


Implementations:
- Iteration:
    - queue "toVisit" and set "Visited"
    - we pop Nodes from 'toVisit' stack and mark them as visited 
    - we only add neighbor to queue if there are NOT visited


TODO: Complexities:
    - Traversal / Shortest Path (exit early):    
        Time:  O(V + E),  
        Space: O(V)
    - Backtracking:  (similar to subset I backtrack)
        Time:  O(2^V * V)
        Space: O(V)
