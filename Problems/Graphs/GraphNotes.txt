Algorithm Use Cases: 

We can summarize this as below-
1) One source and One Destination
    - Use A* Search Algorithm (For Unweighted as well as Weighted Graphs)
2) One Source, All Destination 
    - Use BFS (For Unweighted Graphs)
    - Use Dijkstra (For Weighted Graphs without negative weights)
    - Use Bellman Ford (For Weighted Graphs with negative weights)
3) Between every pair of nodes
    - Floyd-Warshall
    - Johnsonâ€™s Algorithm

Graph Representations (worksheet 40)
- 1.Adjacency Matrix
	- 2D array
	- 1 at (2,3) indicates edge between city 2 and city 3
	- *Weighted: replace 1 with actual value
- 2.Edge List
	ex. Pendleton: {Pueblo, Phoenix}
		Node         Neighbors
	- stores only edges, more efficient for sparse graph w/ few connections
	-* weighted pairs
	ex. Pendleton: {(Pueblo,10),(Phoenix,15)}


Find Reachable (worksheet 41)
******************
findReachable (graph g, vertex start) {
create a set of reachable vertices, initially empty. call this R.
create a container for vertices known to be reachable. call this C
add start vertex to container C
while the container C is not empty {
 	remove first entry from the container C, assign to v
	if v is not already in the set of reachable vertices R 
	{
		add v to the reachable set R
		add the neighbors of v to the container C *if they are not already reachable
 	}
}
return R
}

Container c types: 
stack: Depth first Search
queue: Breadth-first Search
