Time: O(N) to traverse nodes
Space: O(h) where h is height of tree ~ O(N) if leaning unbalanced tree

def main(root):
    # IMPORTANT. NEED TO CONSIDER EMPTY TREE CASE IN MAIN
    if not root:
        return None 
    # traverse tree nodes to find answer
    answer = dfs(root)
    return answer 

dfs(root):
    # base case. Must provide correct answer for None tree !!
    if not root:
        return False 
    
    # recursive case.  Must provide correct answer for Single Node Tree !!
    # 1. Handle Current Node 
    # 2. Recursively call function on Child Nodes to return answer for left and right subtree
    # 3. Use return values from child nodes and Current Node processing 
            a. Update global variable ... (nonlocal only needed if changing value of non-array variable) 
            b. OR return an answer upwards the tree

RECURSION KEY NOTES: 
    - Generally we call recursive function on ROOT:
    - We make successive recursive call on children DOWN the tree, until we reach smallest base case 
        ex. left_depth = dfs_depth(root.left)
        ex. left_p_found = dfs_LCA(root.left)
    - TODO: Structure of dfs helper:
        - Base Case: returns UP the tree, for bigger and bigger subproblems until main problem returns .
            ex. if not root return None
            ex. if not root return False
        - Recursive Case: TODO: make sure this works for single node case first 
            1. Process current Node, such that it works for single Node
            2. Recursive call on all Children
            3. Return answer UPWARD, based on return from children

- Q1:  What answer are we trying to Return upwards from recursive function?
    ex. "Maximum depth of tree with root at Current"
    --> Make sure BASE CASE answers this question for NONE node and SINGLE node
    --> Make sure what we "return Up" the tree is of same return type as answer node
- Q2:   What do we have to pass DOWNWARDS to children via parameters?
- Q2:  What is the main problem? How can we break into subproblems w/ subtree?
    ex.  main problem: are trees identical? ,  subproblems: are subtrees identical?
- Q3:  What is the base case? (No node, or leaf node) .. we know enought to solve subproblem directly.
- Q4:  What is the recursive case?  .. we have to solve subproblem for subtrees first, before answering


- Q:  When to use global variable [] vs. Return from a dfs_function  
    - DFS function:  returns an answer about an entire subtree (ex. depth, contains, same, etc. )
            -> answer and parameters of subtree == answers and parameter main problem
                ex. the sum of tree is the sum of left_subtree + right_subtree + current.val 
                ex. IsMirror of tree is  isMirror (left_subtree)  AND  isMirror (right_subtree)
                ex. MaxDepth = max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
                ex. MaxPathSumToLeaf = max(left_path, right_path) + root.val
    - Global:  returns an answer that is true only at a STATE of a recursive call (LCA, diameter at particular node)
                The answer can lie at ANY point in the tree.
            -> the recursive answer of (left, right) subproblems cant be used to solve answer of bigger problem:
                ex. the diamter of tree root is NOT diameter of left_subtree and right_subtree
                ex. the max_path_sum of node does NOT have to go thru root. Is NOT max of left_sum, right_sum 


ITERATIVE KEY NOTES: https://tinyurl.com/4uwts7fd (all python solutions, using visited)
    - Initialize a stack containing only the Root.  
    - We while loop through stack 
        - Root processed first
        - append left, right to stack ... 
            TODO: IN OPPOSITE ORDER of how we want to process. Check if child exists before adding to stack.
    - Inorder Iterative:
        - Stack: keeps tuples of (node, visited)
        - if visited, append value to res.  If not visited, push (node.leftright, False) and (node, True) to stack.
    - We can attach a "value" to the node in a tuple. Ex. height at this node.

TRAVERSAL NOTES:

- BFS iterative: 
    - Option 1:  only append Value Nodes --> Check if children arent None before append
    - Option 2:  append none nodes too --> Check if we popped Non-None node before appending children
- DFS recursion: 
    - Base Case: 
        - Option 1: Base case Is None 
            - If not Root: 
            - Else (recursive case)
        - Option 2: base case is leaf
            - If not root.left and not root.right:
            - if not root.left: 
            - if not root.right:
            - Else (recursive case)

- Preorder :  Root GUARANTEED front, then left partition, right partition 
- Postorder:  Left partition , right partition, Root
- Inorder:  at any element, values to left are left subtree, values to right are right subtree
