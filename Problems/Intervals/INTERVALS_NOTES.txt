- Generally want to sort Intervals by START 
- We can use constants START = 0, END = 1 to increase readability


- Handle merging by iterating thru Intervals and appending to a res []
    1. Current segment is AFTER -> just append segment
    2. Any Overlap (partial or contained) -> Take MIN(start) and MAX(end) and append

- Inserting
    1. current segment is BEFORE -> append to left []
    2. current segment is AFTER -> append to right []
    3. any overlap -> Update MIN(start) and MAX(end)
