COMMON MISTAKES

General:
    - using = instead of ==
    - need to check if key in dictionary, before incrementing d[key]
    - When using a loop, you must iterate over an ITERABLE.  such as Range(int)

Strings:
    - If casing does not matter, convert string to .lower()
    - If need to modify string, convert to list and then back with "".join(lst)

Array:
    -

Linked List:
    - If we access cur.next.next, cur.next cannot be None
    - Not incrementing current or fast within While loop
